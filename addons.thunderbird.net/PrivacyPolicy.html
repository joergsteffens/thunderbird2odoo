The <strong>Odoo Email Importer</strong> add-on respects your privacy. This
add-on does not collect, track, or transmit personal data to any third party.

<b>Data Access</b>

The add-on accesses email content, headers, and attachments
<strong>only when explicitly triggered by the user</strong>
via the Thunderbird context menu. Accessed data is used solely for the purpose
of importing the selected email into the user’s own Odoo server.

<b>Data Transmission</b>

Email data is transmitted directly from Thunderbird to the Odoo server
configured by the user. No data is sent to the add-on developer or to any
external service other than the configured Odoo instance.

<b>Local Storage</b>

The add-on stores configuration data locally in Thunderbird, such as:

<ul>
  <li>Odoo server URL</li>
  <li>Odoo database name (if required)</li>
  <li>Odoo API key</li>
  <li>User-selected configuration options</li>
</ul>

This information is stored locally using Thunderbird’s extension storage and is
never shared with third parties.

<b>Third-Party Services</b>

The add-on does not use analytics, tracking, advertising, or third-party
telemetry services.

<b>User Control</b>

All actions performed by the add-on require explicit user interaction. No emails
are accessed or transmitted automatically or in the background. Removing the
add-on will remove all locally stored configuration data.
